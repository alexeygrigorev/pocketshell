/**
 * Issue #1681 — the DETERMINISTIC reproduction of the mobile-network
 * self-inflicted lease-close storm (#1680 Track B / H1), keyed on the
 * SELF-INFLICTED signal (G6), on the real connected + Docker + toxiproxy path.
 *
 * ## The maintainer's report (2026-07-18, D33)
 *
 * *"on WiFi it's okayish but when I'm on mobile network it starts breaking —
 * even though everything else works fine."* The storm mechanism (#1680 Track B):
 * on mobile latency a bounded remote exec exceeds the **3.5 s** budget → a
 * bounded-exec site `close()`s the SHARED per-host tmux `-CC` lease → the reader
 * EOFs → the manager mis-reads its OWN self-inflicted EOF as a genuine remote
 * death → reconnect → reattach → reconcile re-classifies → timeout → close →
 * repeat. WiFi RTT stays under 3.5 s so it mostly doesn't trip; mobile RTT
 * spikes over it. #1641 (merged) routes those bounded execs through
 * [com.pocketshell.app.ssh.BoundedSessionExec], which ABANDONS the slow exec and
 * leaves the shared transport untouched — turning the storm into quiet.
 *
 * ## Why this is deterministic (and NOT a server-side sleep — the #1680 thesis)
 *
 * The overrun is caused by NETWORK RTT against the REAL production 3.5 s
 * constant — no widened band, no test-only timing in the assertion path (G6).
 * The toxiproxy `network-fault-proxy` (host 2228 → `agents:22`) applies a
 * symmetric latency toxic so a single SSH round-trip costs ~2 × one-way:
 *
 *  - **Mobile pin** ([ToxiproxyControl.addMobileProfile], RTT ≈ 1.8 s): a
 *    bounded exec is a multi-round-trip channel-open + exec + read (~5 s), so it
 *    overruns the 3.5 s budget, while the `-CC` liveness probe (5 s, a single
 *    round-trip refresh-client), keepalive (30 s), tmux command (10 s), and the
 *    8 s TransportDispatcher per-op ceiling all stay green — ONLY the storm
 *    threshold crosses. (See [ToxiproxyControl.addMobileProfile] for why the RTT
 *    is ~1.8 s, not the recipe's ~4.0 s: at 4.0 s a raw exec trips the 8 s
 *    transport ceiling, confounding the classify's 3.5 s attribution.)
 *  - **WiFi pin** (RTT ≈ 150 ms, [wifiBaselineNoStormNoReconnect]): the classify
 *    completes far under the bound — zero overruns, zero reconnects.
 *
 * These two pinned extremes bracket the monotonic RTT-vs-3.5 s variable, which
 * is strictly stronger than N random samples (the #1633 both-extremes method).
 *
 * ## The self-inflicted signal is CONSTRUCTIVE (the honest key — G6)
 *
 * Pre-#1641 the close was SILENT (no log, no cause-trail), so the RED side
 * cannot key on a breadcrumb. Instead the harness ONLY ever applies a *latency*
 * toxic — it never disables the proxy, never blackholes, never severs the link —
 * so the link is *delayed but never cut*, AND an UN-PROXIED [SshSentinel]
 * exec-pings the fixture SSH port (2222, no toxiproxy) throughout, hard-proving
 * the host + sshd + network stayed perfectly healthy. Under that invariant **any
 * observed lease death is SELF-INFLICTED by construction**, not a real remote
 * drop — that is the "everything else works fine" control the maintainer
 * described, made mechanical.
 *
 * ## Deterministic trigger (confirmed-shell classify over the SHARED `-CC` lease)
 *
 * Only ONE #1680 bounded-exec site borrows the SHARED `-CC` lease the live
 * reader rides: `agent_kind_classify` (`resolveForeignKindGuess` runs
 * [com.pocketshell.app.agents.AgentKindRemoteSource] over the same `sessionRef`).
 * Its overrun is the storm-bearing one — pre-#1641 its `close()` kills the reader.
 * (The RED run PROVED `session_cards_rpc` uses a SEPARATE lease: with the shim
 * restored, its overrun did NOT storm. So keying the fidelity/attribution
 * assertions on ANY `bounded_exec_timeout` would let A2 pass vacuously on RED —
 * they key strictly on `agent_kind_classify`.)
 *
 * The seeded session is pinned `@ps_agent_kind=shell` (confirmed-shell —
 * [setSessionShellKind]), the exact pane class #1641 named as the storm's
 * uncredited entry trigger: it re-runs the classify over the shared lease
 * whenever the pane's `(cwd, command, tty)` input changes
 * ([com.pocketshell.app.tmux.TmuxSessionViewModel] `startAgentDetectionForPane`
 * / `refreshForeignGuessForConfirmedShellPane`). After the mobile profile is
 * applied, [forceReclassifyOverDegradedLink] changes the ACTIVE pane's cwd and
 * forces an active-window reconcile, so the next classify runs over the degraded
 * `-CC` lease and overruns.
 *
 * ## Red → green (validating both the repro and #1641 — G1/D33)
 *
 * - **RED** (v0.4.38 `close()`-on-timeout shim restored in
 *   [com.pocketshell.app.ssh.BoundedSessionExec] — the one-file revert quoted in
 *   its own class doc): the bounded exec overruns at 3.5 s → closes the shared
 *   lease → `-CC` reader EOF → `passive_disconnect classification=real_tmux_
 *   control_channel_closed`. [assertConnectedStaysNoSelfInflictedDrop] FAILS with
 *   that exact signature while the sentinel is still alive.
 * - **GREEN** (current main, post-#1641): the bounded exec is abandoned, a
 *   `cause_trail stage=bounded_exec_timeout outcome=abandoned_transport_preserved
 *   transportAlive=true transportClosed=false` breadcrumb is recorded, status
 *   never leaves Connected, and a fresh marker still round-trips.
 *
 * ## Gate wiring
 *
 * This is a [NetworkFaultProofBase] toxiproxy proof — it self-skips on per-PR CI
 * ([assumeNetworkFaultProofsEnabled] → `tests.yml` leaves `network-fault-proxy`
 * / toxiproxy down), so wiring it into `scripts/ci-journey-suite.sh` would only
 * ALL-SKIP (the G3 trap). It runs in the phase-2 network-fault cohort of
 * `scripts/nightly-extensive-suite.sh` with the proxy family up, alongside its
 * `NatIdleMappingSurvivalE2eTest` / `PacketLossNetworkFaultE2eTest` siblings.
 *
 * There is NO `assumeTrue` / `assumeFalse(isRunningOnCi())` on any load-bearing
 * assertion (D31/D32 F3): the two `assumeNetworkFaultProofsEnabled()` gates only
 * un-gate the opt-in Docker fixture, never the storm assertion itself.
