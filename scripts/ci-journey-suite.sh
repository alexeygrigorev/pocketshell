# Per-push CI journey suite — load-bearing subset (issue #691, epic #657).
#
# The #638 mandate: the load-bearing session-switch / reconnect JOURNEY proofs
# must run in REGULAR per-push CI, not only nightly + the release gate. Before
# this, `tests.yml` ran no `androidTest` at all, so a PR could merge green while
# silently regressing within-grace ride-through, beyond-grace reattach, the
# A->B->C->A no-bleed switch, no-resurrect, and reseed-on-reattach — exactly the
# #685 failure mode.
#
# This driver runs inside the `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner`
# `script:` step, so the emulator is already booted and `adb` is on PATH. The
# deterministic Docker `agents` fixture (agents:2222 -> emulator 10.0.2.2:2222)
# was started + waited-healthy by the workflow before this script runs.
#
# It runs ONLY the load-bearing subset (NOT the full connected suite — that
# stays nightly). Every class below uses the plain deterministic `agents:2222`
# fixture; NONE need the opt-in toxiproxy network-fault proxies, so the job is
# deterministic and does not depend on the proxy family the per-push job
# deliberately leaves down. `pocketshellCi=true` selects the generous E2E
# timeout ceilings so a slow CI runner does not flake these out.
#
# Load-bearing subset and what each pins:
#   * DeepLinkSessionSwitchE2eTest (issue #470)
#       - picker-FREE programmatic attach via the production deep-link intent
#         (MainActivity.EXTRA_OPEN_SESSION_*): lands directly on
#         AppDestination.TmuxSession so TmuxSessionScreen auto-connects via the
#         real `tmux -CC` attach. Asserts per attach: terminal view attaches
#         (NEVER black/blank), the attached session's own seed marker is visible
#         (correct/non-stale/re-seeded), no Disconnected band/EOF, and the OTHER
#         session's marker does not bleed in. The A->B "switch" is a fresh
#         deep-link to B. This is the load-bearing terminal-attach/switch proof.
#
# PICKER-DRIVEN journeys (issue #705): the shared session-PICKER enumeration
# (FolderListGateway.listSessionsWithFolder over the warm SSH lease) was WEDGED
# on the AVD — every test that taps a host row and waited on
# `waitForSessionInPicker` stalled (picker never left Loading). That wedge is
# now FIXED (the lease-bound cold connect/handshake of #687 + the picker fix in
# #702), and the over-broad header assertion that collided with the #628
# previous-session toggle controls is corrected in #705. So three picker-driven
# journeys (MultiSessionSwitchJourneyE2eTest,
# ColdRestoreGoneSessionNoResurrectE2eTest, ReconnectRepaintE2eTest) re-join
# this per-push subset below — each was proven GREEN on a pooled AVD before
# re-adding (no flake, no CI email spam).
#
# RE-ADDED (issue #707): BackgroundGraceReconnectE2eTest now re-joins this subset.
# The triage (#707) established the within-grace `terminal_foreground_reattach`
# diagnostic was a BENIGN fan-out marker, not a real reconnect: since #548 /
# commit 1271a60e, App.kt fires dispatchTmuxForeground() unconditionally on every
# foreground (even within grace) so a stale transport is probed early, and that
# call records `terminal_foreground_reattach` purely as a dispatch label. The
# E2E `assertNoReconnectOrReattachDiagnostics` is now narrowed to forbid only
# the GENUINE reconnect signals (reconnect_start, network_reconnect_start, the
# VM-level foreground_reattach, foreground_runtime_probe_failed,
# terminal_background_teardown) — none of which fire within grace — so both its
# tests are green. No production code changed; the triage confirmed the #685
# grace path is correct.
#
# The heavy/long-running + toxiproxy network-fault + bootstrap-matrix suites
# stay in nightly-extensive.yml. This is intentionally the fast per-push subset.

# Issue #705: three picker-driven journeys re-join the picker-FREE
# DeepLinkSessionSwitchE2eTest now that the picker enumeration wedge is fixed
# (#687 + #702) and the over-broad header assertion is scoped to the breadcrumb
# crumb (#705). Each was proven GREEN on a pooled AVD before re-adding.
# BackgroundGraceReconnectE2eTest re-joins this subset (#707): the within-grace
# `terminal_foreground_reattach` it forbade was a benign fan-out marker, not a
# reconnect; the assertion is narrowed to genuine reconnect signals only.
#
# Issue #710 (RE-ADDED): MultiSessionSwitchJourneyE2eTest is back in this
# per-push subset. It was quarantined under #691 (58d9957f) because it wedged
# (never finished) on the GitHub android-emulator-runner AVD while passing on
# the local pooled AVD — the rapid A->B->C->A switch backgrounded a just-switched
# runtime whose VM-clear park then stalled the main thread on an UNBOUNDED
# `cancelAndJoin()` over a pane job wedged in a non-cooperative `-CC` socket read
# (run 27368527630 burned ~67 min to the job cap). #710 bounds that teardown
# (`CachedTmuxRuntime.closeCachedRuntime` + `closeCachedRuntimesBlocking`) at
# SYNC_DETACH_TIMEOUT_MS so the main thread is guaranteed to return, removing the
# CI-AVD wedge. The per-test `timeout_msec` backstop below stays as defense in
# depth so ANY future wedge fails fast (~5 min) instead of hanging the job.
